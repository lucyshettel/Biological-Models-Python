# Biological-Models-Python
Final Project from Biological Models in Python

Write a Python program that can perform these tasks:
1) Read a sequence in FASTA format.
2) Evolve a sequence according to the Jukes-Cantor model + indels by simulating a random
branching process and print out the tree in Newick format.
3) Write a file in FASTA format containing all the sequences corresponding to the leaves of
a simulated tree.
4) Read a file with multiple sequences.
5) Align sequences in a pairwise fashion, calculate their Hamming or p distance and store
results in a distance matrix.
6) Use the distance matrix from the previous step to infer the phylogentic tree using the
UPGMA and write the tree in Newick format.
